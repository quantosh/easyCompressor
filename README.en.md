# Easy Compressor

**Easy Compressor** is a browser extension that lets you apply real-time dynamic audio compression to any tab, with a visual meter and adjustable parameters.

## Manual Installation (not available in Chrome Web Store)

> **Note:** This extension is not published in the Chrome Web Store because Google requires a payment to publish, which is not feasible for a free and open source project. You can install it manually as follows:

### 1. Download or clone the repository

Download this project as a ZIP or clone it with:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/quantosh/easyCompressor.git
```

Or simply download the `Easy.Compressor` folder to your PC.

### 2. Open your browser's extensions page

For Chrome/Edge:
```
chrome://extensions/
```
For Firefox:
```
about:addons
```

Enable **Developer mode** (top right).

### 3. Load the unpacked extension

Click **"Load unpacked"** (Chrome/Edge) or **"Install Add-on From File"** (Firefox) and select the `Easy.Compressor` folder (where `manifest.json` is located).

Done! You can now use the extension.

## Usage

- Click the extension icon to open the popup.
- Click **Enable Compressor** to activate compression on the current tab.
- Click **Settings** to adjust threshold, ratio, and see the real-time gain reduction meter.

## Why isn't it in the Web Store?

Google requires a payment to publish extensions, even free ones. This project is open source and non-profit, so it's only available for manual installation.

## Multi-browser Support

- Download the correct release ZIP for your browser from the [Releases](https://github.com/quantosh/easyCompressor/releases) page:
  - `Easy.Compressor-chrome.zip` for Chrome
  - `Easy.Compressor-edge.zip` for Edge
  - `Easy.Compressor-firefox.zip` for Firefox
- Each ZIP contains the correct manifest for your browser.
